Hi, I'm Juan.

I'm a developer with a passion for computer science, games, music and climbing.
I'm enthusiastic about productivity and I'm always looking for ways to make my
development environment faster and easier to use.

That means I have waaaay too many [dotfiles](https://github.com/juanibiapina/dotfiles).

I sometimes profile my shell start up times or rework my neovim plugins, shortcuts or
shell aliases, almost always getting inspiration from other cool projects or people
I've met. I also develop small tools to help with repetitive command line tasks.

I wish [sub](https://github.com/juanibiapina/sub) was more well known. 
I'm so proud of that.
I have one user.
Thanks [@awendt](https://github.com/awendt).

Creator of [basher](https://github.com/basherpm/basher).
