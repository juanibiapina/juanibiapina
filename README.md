Hi, I'm Juan.

I'm a developer with a passion for computer science, games and music. I love
learning new things, specially programming languages. I'm very enthusiastic
about productivity and I'm always looking for ways to make my development
environment faster and easier to use.

My [dotfiles](https://github.com/juanibiapina/dotfiles) is an ongoing effort in
productivity for the command line. I often profile my shell start up times or
rework my vim plugins, shortcuts and aliases, almost always getting inspiration
for other cool projects or people I've met. I also develop small tools like
[jaime](https://github.com/juanibiapina/jaime) and
[shelf](https://github.com/juanibiapina/shelf) to help with repetitive tasks.
 
I'm currently working as a Principal Software Developer for
[Babbel](www.babbel.com). My resume is openly hosted on GitHub and can be found
[here](https://github.com/juanibiapina/resume)
