Hi, I'm Juan.

I'm a developer with a passion for computer science, games, music and climbing.
I'm enthusiastic about productivity and I'm always looking for ways to make my
development environment faster and easier to use.

My [dotfiles](https://github.com/juanibiapina/dotfiles) is an ongoing effort in
productivity for the command line. I often profile my shell start up times or
rework my vim plugins, shortcuts and aliases, almost always getting inspiration
from other cool projects or people I've met. I also develop small tools like
[sub](https://github.com/juanibiapina/sub) to help with repetitive tasks.

Creator of [basher](https://github.com/basherpm/basher).
 
I'm currently working as a Principal Software Developer for
[Babbel](https://www.babbel.com). My resume is openly hosted on GitHub and can be found
[here](https://github.com/juanibiapina/resume)
